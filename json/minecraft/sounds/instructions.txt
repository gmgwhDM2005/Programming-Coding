Welcome to the sounds tutorial of the JSON section

Use the following steps below to learn how to play custom music into Minecraft!

1) Create a resource pack folder

2) Create a manifest.json file, filling in the additional details
Help with this can be found at the bottom of this document

3) Create a sounds file, so should be rpfoldername/sounds/

4) Create a sound_definitions.json file within sounds

5) Copy the file text found in my github at coding/json/minecraft/sounds/sound_definitions.json
(Any instructions listed inside the file must be followed)

6) Create a folder called audio within the sounds folder

7) Insert your audio into the audio folder (rpfoldername/sounds/audio)
only .ogg or .flac files are accepted
Using an online .mp3 to .ogg convertor can do the trick!

8) Place the Resource pack into your world folder and your ready to go!

Enjoy
